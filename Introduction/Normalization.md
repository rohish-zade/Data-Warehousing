## Normalization
Data normalization is a database design technique that helps organize data in a relational database to reduce redundancy and dependency.
Used to organize data efficiently, minimize redundancy, and eliminate undesirable characteristics like insertion, update, and deletion anomalies.
It involves dividing a database into smaller tables and defining relationships between them, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

The concept of normalization is based on normal forms (NF), which are levels of database organization. Each normal form builds upon the previous one, with higher normal forms reducing data redundancy and complexity.

**Goals of Normalization:**
- Reduce Data Redundancy: Avoid storing the same data in multiple places.
- Improve Data Integrity: Ensure that data remains accurate, consistent, and up to date.
- Minimize Anomalies: Prevent issues like insertion, update, and deletion anomalies.
