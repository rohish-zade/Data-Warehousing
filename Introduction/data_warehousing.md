## What is Data Warehousing

A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores large amounts of structured data from various sources for analysis and reporting.

- Central repository of integrated data from one or more different sources.
- Stores current and historical data in a single place.

### Key Features of a Data Warehouse:

#### 1. **Integrated:** 
  - Combines data from multiple sources (e.g., databases, spreadsheets, and external systems) into a unified format.
#### 2. **Subject-Oriented:** 
  - Focuses on specific areas like sales, finance, or marketing, allowing users to analyze data from different business functions.
#### 3. **Non-Volatile:** 
  - Once data is stored in a data warehouse, it is stable and typically not altered. Updates to data are done through new records (e.g., adding historical records or new periods).
#### 4. **Time-Variant:** 
  - Tracks changes over time, helping in trend analysis, forecasting, and decision-making.
